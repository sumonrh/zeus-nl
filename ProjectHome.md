# ZEUS-NL Source Code Release #

ZEUS-NL is the analysis and simulation platform of the [Mid-America Earthquake (MAE) Center](http://mae.cee.uiuc.edu/). It is a state-of-the-art 3D static and dynamic platform specifically developed for earthquake engineering applications. Its extreme efficiency, accuracy, verification and user-friendly graphical user interface has made it easier than ever to undertake inelastic large displacement analysis of complex frames using the fiber approach, with a suite of material models and elements. The MAE Center requires that publications, including results from ZEUS-NL, include an acknowledgment of [Mid-America Earthquake Center](http://mae.cee.uiuc.edu/) and the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/) (Award Number EEC-9701785). The use of the software and associated documentation files is subjected to the [copyright agreement](http://zeus-nl.googlecode.com/files/Open_Source_License.pdf).

With this project ZEUS-NL becomes open source allowing users to add their own features such as material models, elements and so on. ZEUS-NL is written in FORTRAN 77. The developer team has provided documentation on implementation of new features.

Now MAE Center is looking for new users and contributors to its finite element analysis package ZEUS-NL.
