= ZEUS-NL References =

The PDF file below has a list of references that include analysis results from ZEUS-NL with links to original articles. 

[https://zeus-nl.googlecode.com/files/List_of_References.pdf List_of_References.pdf]

The list is intended to be comprehensive, however, it is possible that there exist publications that the developer team could not locate yet or published after the list is compiled.

Note that ZEUS-NL was formerly called “ADAPTIC” and “INDYAS” and some of the earlier publications refer to the software with these names.
