= Element Model Implementation in ZEUS-NL =

This page describes briefly how to implement element models in ZEUS-NL. Sample source files are also provided for an example element model.



=== Example element model ===

Example element model is the lumped mass model (lmass). Following element name and number is used for an example element model in ZEUS-NL.
  * Element name : em35
  * Element number : 35


=== Provided source code ===

The provided sample source files contain all necessary subroutines for the implementation of a new element model. Only the subroutines in these files are needed to be modified to meet the requirements of the new element model.
  * Source file for the Reader of ZEUS-NL : em35.f
  * Source file for the Solver of ZEUS-NL : EM35.f


=== Implementation Procedure ===

  # Modify/Update provided source FORTRAN files (em35.f and EM35.f) based on your own element model
    * In both source files, carefully read the comments in each subroutine and understand how each subroutine works before getting started with the new model
  # After finishing coding, compile modified source files (refer to documentation on “ZEUS-NL compilation procedure”)
  # Debug until the element model is validated
