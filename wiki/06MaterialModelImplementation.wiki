This page how to implement material models in ZEUS-NL. Sample source files are also provided for an example material model.



=== Example material model ===

Example material models are the bilinear elasto-plastic model with kinematic strain-hardening for steel material (stl1) and trilinear concrete model (con1). Following material names and numbers are used for example material models in ZEUS-NL.
  * Material name : mm11 & mm12
  * Material number : 11 & 12


=== Provided source code ===

The sample source files provided contain all necessary subroutines for the implementation of a new material model. Only the subroutines in these files are needed to be modified to meet the requirements of the new material model.
  * Source file for the Reader of ZEUS-NL : mm11.f (for steel) & mm12.f (for concrete)
  * Source file for the Solver of ZEUS-NL : MM11.f (for steel) & MM12.f (for concrete)


=== Implementation Procedure ===

  # Modify/Update provided source FORTRAN files (mm11.f and MM11.f or mm12.f and MM12.f) based on your own material model
    * In both source files, carefully read the comments in each subroutine and understand how each subroutine works before getting started with the new model
  # After finishing coding, compile modified source files (refer to documentation on “ZEUS-NL compilation procedure”)
  # Debug until the material model is validated
